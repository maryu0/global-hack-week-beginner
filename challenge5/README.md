# Infinite Loading Screen

A fun and completely useless hack that simulates a never-ending loading animation.This program serves no purpose other than to entertain and annoy!

## How It Works

- The program creates a loading animation using a set of characters that loops endlessly.
- It updates the animation every 0.1 seconds.
- The program will run forever unless you manually stop it (CTRL+C).
